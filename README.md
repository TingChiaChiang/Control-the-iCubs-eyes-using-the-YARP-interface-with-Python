# Control-the-iCubs-eyes-using-the-IGazeControl-YARP-interface-with-Python

I created three methods to control iCubâ€™s eyes using a Python scprit. The first one is to look at a fixation point in Cartesian coordinates. The second one is to look at a fixation point in an absolute angular coordinate system. The last one is to retrieve the current fixation point (may used to measure the displacement error). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install YARP and iCub from sources and compile them properly before running the python script.

```

```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/TingChiaChiang/Control-the-iCubs-eyes-using-the-YARP-interface-with-Python.git
```

## Running the tests
### Step 1

First step is to have a yarpserver running.

Open a terminal and run: 
   
```
yarpserver
```
The terminal will look like this:

### Step 2
To run an iCub simulator, open a second terminal and type:
```
iCub_SIM
```
The simulator should look like this:

### Step 3
To use the iKinGazeCtrl module in the simulator, you need to select the proper configuration file. 

Open another terminal and type:

```
iKinGazeCtrl --from configSim.ini
```
### Step 4
Finally, go the the directory where you downloaded the python script and run

```
python python_igaze_control.py
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
