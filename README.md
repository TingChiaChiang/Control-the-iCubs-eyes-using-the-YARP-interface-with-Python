# Control-the-iCubs-eyes-using-the-IGazeControl-YARP-interface-with-Python

I created three methods to control iCubâ€™s eyes using a Python scprit. The first one is to look at a fixation point in Cartesian coordinates. The second one is to look at a fixation point in an absolute angular coordinate system. The last one is to retrieve the current fixation point (may used to measure the displacement error). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Install YARP and iCub from sources and compile them properly 

```
http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the code

### Break down into end to end tests

At one terminal, run 
   
   at another terminal 
   $iCub_SIM
   at another terminal
   $ iKinGazeCtrl --from configSim.ini

```
yarpserver
```

At another terminal 


'''
iCub_SIM
'''

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
